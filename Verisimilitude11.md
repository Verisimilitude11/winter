# Smart Plant Watering System

## Summary

I am going to build a smart plant watering system that uses a microcontroller and sensors to automatically water my plants based on soil moisture levels. I am excited to build this project because I love plants, but I often forget to water them. This system will help me take better care of my plants and save water by only watering when needed.

## Plan

1. Research different microcontrollers and sensors that can be used to build a smart plant watering system.
2. Create a list of components and materials needed for the project, including a microcontroller, moisture sensors, a water pump, and a water reservoir.
3. Purchase the components and materials needed for the project.
4. Assemble the system using the microcontroller, sensors, pump, and water reservoir.
5. Write code for the microcontroller to control the pump based on the moisture levels detected by the sensors.
6. Test the system to ensure that it is functioning correctly.
7. Make any necessary adjustments or improvements to the system.

## Budget

What materials will you need for your project? Where will you get them? How much does it cost? Please include all materials, including components you already own. Make sure to factor in shipping costs and sales tax.
